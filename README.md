# AnyLint-Swift

The [AnyLint](https://github.com/Flinesoft/AnyLint) community-collected configurations project for the Swift community.

## Configurations

A configuration can be placed into an AnyLint configuration file like so:

```Swift
// MARK: Swift/Core
try Lint.runChecks(source: .github(repo: "Flinesoft/AnyLint-Swift", version: "main", variant: "Swift/Core"))
```

### Swift

If you are using Swift, you will probably want to use the `Swift/Core` configuration.

Other configurations might follow and will be more opinionated towards a specific programming style.

### Xcode

There is no `Core` configuration here yet.

* If you have `ObjectiveC` files in your project, use the `Xcode/ObjectiveC` variant.
* If you have a projects with localized Strings files, use the `Xcode/Strings` variant.
* If you are using the [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) dependency manager, use the `Xcode/Carthage` variant.
* If you are using [SwiftGen](https://github.com/SwiftGen/SwiftGen) for accessing resources, use the `Xcode/SwiftGen` variant.

Other configurations might follow and will be more opinionated towards a specific programming style.

### Docs

If you want to document your project, you will probably want to use the `Docs/Core` configuration.

Other configurations might follow and will be more opinionated towards a specific documentation styles.
